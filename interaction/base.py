        BankID's animated QR rotates server-side every ~1 second and the
        overall order expires in ~30 s (docs/sensors.md § 86). A polling loop
        that ignores rotating `qr_code` field in poll responses will let the
        BankID order time out with `start_failed` even though the viewer
        appears live (observed 2026-06-02 from `dim sync`).

        Default: NO-OP. Providers that open a single self-refreshing surface
        (e.g. LocalHtmlInteractionProvider's `qr.html` viewer) override this
        with an atomic PNG replace so the open tab's 800 ms refresh picks up
        the new code without opening a second window. Providers that open a
        new OS-level viewer per call (LocalInteractionProvider → Preview)
        rightly leave this as no-op — calling display_qr_code each time would
        spawn a new Preview window per second.
